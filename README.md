# NewsCatcher

As part of the NCRI (Network Contagion Research Institute) and the Governor's STEM Scholars program, our joint team has and is working on projects that aim to expose the ripples mis/disinformation and other negative aspects caused by actions of varying online groups in social media and other locations on the web. Some examples are the prospects of inauthentic activity caused by bot networks to increase hype before an anticipated event, as well as the often undocumented effects of censoring prominent figures in controversial communities. To best respond to such events as a rapid-response group, the usage of the NewsCatcher API would allow us to search for relevant information in an efficient manner to assist in the discovery of findings that can outline potentially dangerous events before they occur, as well as prior ones that were overlooked.
